# r/selfhosted security guides

[![CC-BY-SA](https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-sa/4.0/88x31.png)](LICENSE.md)

Started from the beginners security guide on r/selfhosted - this repo aims to be a collection of guides on all levels for those who seek to make their selfhosted applications and servers more secure.


# What is this?

This place aims to be a collection of security-related knowledge, mainly on the blue-team side. (As there are plenty of red-team collections out there already)

Most guides are third-party while I and some people around me happily contribute (or might do so in the future) to a few self-baked ones as well.

This collection was created in order to help people gain some insight in what they're exposing to the internet and what is or isn't reasonable security in one's situation.
